# workshop_NLP
This is the workshop materials for NLP Python Programming. 
We will build a very simple NLP model with a simple Text data. 
It will predict what sentiment (positive and negative) Text data represents. 
It will walk though
  - Import Text data
  - Tokenization: Convert Text to numeric vectors
  - Embedding
  - Build RNN (LSTM) model
  - Train RNN model with Tokenized Text data
  - Predict Text 

It will require numpy, pandas, sklearn, keras, gensim
